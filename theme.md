The overall theme for this design, compatible with Tailwind CSS, can be described as "Professional Banking Data Platform with Subtle Red Accents."

Here are the key characteristics and elements you can use as a reference:

Color Palette:

Primary Background: Light, clean, and professional. Think neutral-50 or neutral-100 in Tailwind for main backgrounds.
Text/Primary Content: Darker neutrals for readability, such as neutral-800 or neutral-900.
Accent Red: A strong, clear red for emphasis. This should be used for:
Call-to-action buttons (e.g., bg-red-600, hover:bg-red-700).
Progress indicators (e.g., bg-red-500 for fill).
Status indicators (e.g., text-red-600 for warnings or critical statuses).
Chart elements or key performance indicators that need to draw attention.
Subtle highlights or borders.
Secondary/Neutral Accents: Use a range of grays for borders, inactive states, and secondary text (e.g., neutral-200 to neutral-400).
Success Indicators: A clear green for success messages or completed steps (e.g., text-green-600, bg-green-100).
Typography:

Font Family: A clean, modern sans-serif font. Think font-sans in Tailwind, potentially configuring it to a font like Inter, Lato, or Open Sans for a professional feel.
Headings: Bold and impactful, but not overly large, to maintain a business-like tone.
Body Text: Highly readable, standard sizes.
Labels/Descriptions: Slightly smaller or lighter text for supplementary information.
Layout & Spacing (Tailwind Utility Classes):

Clean & Organized: Utilize flexbox and grid extensively for structured layouts (e.g., flex, grid grid-cols-2, gap-4).
Generous Padding & Margins: Use Tailwind's spacing scale (e.g., p-4, py-8, mb-6) to create ample whitespace, which contributes to a premium feel and improves readability.
Card-based Layouts: Many sections (like institution types, data sources, pricing plans) are presented in distinct cards. Use bg-white, rounded-lg, shadow-md, and p-6 (or similar) for these.
Form Elements:
Inputs and selects should have a consistent border (e.g., border border-gray-300, rounded).
Focus states should be clear, possibly with a subtle red ring (focus:ring-red-200).
Progress Indicators: Linear progress bars (w-full, h-2, rounded-full) and clearly defined steps.
Specific Elements to replicate (with red accent examples):

Progress Bar: The filled part of the progress bar (bg-red-500).
Step Indicators: The active/completed step numbers and labels could have text-red-600 or bg-red-600 for the circle.
Call-to-Action Buttons: bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded.
Selected Options/Cards: A subtle red border (border-red-500) and/or a light red background (bg-red-50) to indicate selection. The checkmark icon could be text-red-500.
Error Messages: text-red-600.
Security Badges/Info Boxes: Can use a very light background (e.g., bg-blue-50 or bg-gray-50) with a darker text. The lock icon could be text-blue-500 or text-gray-700.
This theme emphasizes professionalism, clarity, and trust, with the red accents drawing attention to critical information and actions in a sophisticated manner.A
